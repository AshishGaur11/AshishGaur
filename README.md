- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AshishGaur11
Ability of transforming, from sand to silicon wafer for Perseverance rover on mars to
the Quantum computers in our universities is not just for amazement, it comes with a
great responsibility of TRANSFORMING HUMAN LIFE & these wonders and
transformation don't just take place by their own, unless & until people like you & me
invest their abilities & resources within available designs and technologies. I think
thatâ€™s we are for Transform & making connections. I am a Computer Science Engineer.
